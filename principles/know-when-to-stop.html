                <p>We often seek perfection and spend a lot of time optimizing and adjusting our software to meet
                    possibilities that might not happen â€“ the "what if" syndrome.</p>
                <p>If you look at <a href="clear-goals.html">this principle</a>, you'll notice that, generally,
                    effectiveness is better than efficiency. This means your code will change eventually, so it's better
                    to be going the right way by doing something wrong in the way there than the opposite. In other
                    words, stop when you know that you've reached your goal, not something you think will be happening
                    if...
                </p>
                <p>This principle is one of the reasons this collection only has 5 principles. I could've added many
                    more, but then it would be harder for me to remember them all. Instead, I keep the ones I believe
                    are the core principles for the present moment.</p>
