                <p>The principle that we often seem to forget during our working sessions.</p>
                <p>When was the last time you started developing something and let your brain dump every technique
                    possible, beautiful lines of code crafted to optimize every inch of your system, reused and abstract
                    every duplicate piece of code, or even apply all the latest hot paradigms?</p>
                <p>For me, this happens more often than not. We tend to make things more complicated than they need to
                    be. Why? Are we trying to impress anyone? Flex about our coding skills?</p>
                <p>Take this website as an example. I could've used GO+HTMX, Hugo, Next.js, or any other fancy tool to
                    build it, but instead, this is just plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to detect your system color
                    scheme.</p>
                <p>Don't outsmart yourself and write simple, stupid code that, together, builds a complex system.</p>
