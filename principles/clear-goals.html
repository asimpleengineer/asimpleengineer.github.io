                <p>Having a complete vision about what you need to do when you start a new project can be really
                    difficult, if not impossible. Yes, you can have a vision about the end product, but the steps to get
                    there can be similar to the moves in a chess game.</p>
                <p>Dealing with the unknown is much like traversing a forest where you need to reach point X. Instead of
                    trying to go directly for point X, try point A first. This "divide and conquer" approach will help
                    both mentally and will set you one step closer to the final solution.</p>
                <p>When planning your next step, it's okay to try or explore new things. If point A is not getting you
                    any closer to X, don't wait to reach it; adjust your course. What's really important when doing so
                    is to have a fast feedback loop that allows you to adapt and fallback into the right path.</p>
                <p>Know where you want to go, plan how to get there one step at a time.</p>
